What is the Generic Game Metaserver?

A game metaserver is the piece of code that provides some or all of the 
backend services for an online game.  Services such as matching clients with 
servers, updating clients, and allowing players to chat with one another 
outside of a game.

This implementation, as of v1.0, currently supports only one of those 
services, specifically, client/server matching.  It is the rawest 
implementation, supporting no command line options, requiring a recompile 
to change the listening port, and supporting no configuration file.  It 
compiles only under Linux, and does not use GNU autoconf or automake.

REQUIREMENTS:

You will need Linux and a recent C++ compiler which supports the Standard 
Template Library.  This software was developed on a Dual Pentium II 300 
running Linux kernel 2.2.16 SMP using GNU Make 3.77 and the GNU Compiler 
Collection 2.95.3 C and C++ compilers.  If it compiles and runs on any other 
configuration, it's purely coincidental.

COMPILING:

As of the initial release, if you have the requirements above, simply type 
"make" in each of the three directories: metaserver and the child directories 
TestClient and TestServer.  Both an -O2 optimized, stripped production version 
and a debug version will be compiled.
