Generic Game Metaserver TODO List

At the moment, this code fulfills only the most basic function of a 
traditional metaserver.  That is, client/server matching works, and nothing 
else.  Further enhancements will be:

- Integrate the dotconf library so the server can read a configuration file
- Take advantage of the dotconf library's ability to handle modules to 
  modularize the entire server
- Create configurable client version checker and patch server module
- Create user chat module
- Create metaserver link module to enable a network of metaservers
- Extend server information gathered to include server type, server version, 
  number of players connected, and server uptime
- Port to other UN*Xs besides Linux
- Solaris(x86): need to come up with a solution for missing getopts_long()
- Wide character support for server type and other descriptive strings

These items won't necessarily be completed in the order listed.  In fact, it's 
unlikely.  They'll be completed as time allows and demand requires.
