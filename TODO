Generic Game Metaserver TODO List

At the moment, this code fulfills only the most basic function of a 
traditional metaserver.  That is, client/server matching works, and nothing 
else.  Further enhancements will be:

- Integrate the dotconf library so the server can read a configuration file
- Take advantage of the dotconf library's ability to handle modules to 
  modularize the entire server
- Create configurable client version checker and patch server module
- Create user chat module
- Create metaserver link module to enable a network of metaservers
- Extend server information gathered to include server type, server version, 
  number of players connected, and server uptime.
- Support GNU autoconf and automake
- Port to other UN*Xs besides Linux.
- Add commandline options, including help and version

These items won't necessarily be completed in the order listed.  In fact, it's 
unlikely.  They'll be completed as time allows and demand requires.
