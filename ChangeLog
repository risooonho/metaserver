	Initial Release
	
	v1.0 September 17, 2000
	Polished and waxed with lots of English text and published.

	v1.1 September 30, 2000
	Added command-line parsing to metaserver.  Added complementary code
	in test client and server to allow the user to specify port.
	Metaserver can now return version and help information, and bind to a
	specified port and/or specified IP address.

	v1.2 November 16, 2000
	Merged autoconf/automake, BSD port, and hostname lookups by Demitar.
	Added ability to self-daemonize and behave politely as a daemon.
	Configure your syslog to show you daemon notices to see its production
	messages, and add daemon debug to see debug messages.
	To activate debug code in the daemon, run configure under (t)csh as:
	env CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG ./configure
	or under Bourne as:
	CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG ./configure
